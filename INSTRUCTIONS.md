# How to run the code
All the Python Sender implementation is imported to client.py
In order to run everything you can run it all individual or
```
python3 client.py
```
or
```
python client.py
```

In client.py there are 3 macro booleans that you can adjust to
use the different protocols.

* You could also just run the files itself if it's easier

## File checking
file_check.py checks if the input and output mp3 files
are the same.

We do this by checking if the lengths are the same, then checking
whether the individual items at each index are the same.
